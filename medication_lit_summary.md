# Molnupiravir
Molnupiravir is ribonucleoside analog that can swap between cytidine (C) and uridine (U). It inhibits viral reproduction by introducing lethal mutation in the viral genomes through insertion in the RNA polymerase. It is suggested to be only used in adults.

Molnupiravir does not show clinical benefit in hospitalized patients from an interim analysis in a phase 3 trial. https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04575584

No available data for activity against Omicron in cell cultures. 


# Paxlovid
Paxlovid is a combination of antiviral nirmatrelvir and ritonavir.  It is the treatment for people > 12 yrs old. Nirmatrelvir is a SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor, and ritonavir is an HIV-1 protease inhibitor and Cytochrome P450 inhibitor.

Paxlovid showed antiviral activity against alpha, beta, delta and lambda variants in cell culture; Nirmatrelvir showed activity against Omicron in a biochemical assay (Owen et al. Science 2021).
# Bebtelovimab
Bebtelovimab is a IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2, can be used with other two monoclonal antibodies, bamlanivimab(BAM) and etesevimab(ETE) together. Bebtelovimab alone shows neutralizing effect on BA.1 and BA.2 Omicron subvariants in cell culture (Westendorf et al. bioRxiv 2022).

# Remdesivir
The earlist antiviral used to treat COVID-19. It showed efficacy in both hospitalized (Beigel et al. NEJM 2020) and non-hospitalized (Gottlieb et al. NEJM 2022) patients. Remdesivir is an analog of adenosine (A), it inhibits RNA replication of SARS-CoV-2 by intefering RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
